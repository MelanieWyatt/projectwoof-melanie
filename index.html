<div class="text">
	<p>Australian Poms are adorable and fuzzy dogs that require quite a few things. For example, they don't like to be left alone for a long time. They don't adapt well to living in apartments or other small spaces so they need to be in a bigger and more spacious environment. They are very active dogs, so they require daily excersize such as a walk outisde or a lot of play time.</p>
</div>
<div class="text">
	<p>They also require you to take care of the grooming that is associated with them which is going to be day to day care. They require this because they shed a lot and need a regular brushing and shampooing. They do however come with the risk of suffering from teeth/heart issues, kneecap dislocations,and being deaf or blind.</p>
